                    <p>I have a super cute dog named Tobi! He's a fluffy and cute goldendoodle and the love of my life haha. I love him so much that I have over a thousand photos of him on my phone...</p>

                    <p>Art has always been a big part of my life. I'm most experienced with traditional art, like drawing and painting, but I've also been experiencing with digital art. Although I'm not making a career out of art, I hope that I can continue to practice and develop my skills.</p>

                <div id="p3">
                    <p>I'm passionate about increasing the female presence in the tech industry. I'm not the most out-there type of person but in high school, I started a Girls Who Code club because I was fed up with how boys in my school's CS club would treat me. Even in my CS class at GT, I feel like I'm overwhelmingly surrounded by boys.</p>

                    <p>Food is essential for life, but I also just like eating it because it tastes good. I have a really big sweet tooth, which I satisfy by baking. Before I left for college, I baked egg tarts and a burnt basque cheesecake. They both turned out so good, and I shared them with my friends :D</p>
